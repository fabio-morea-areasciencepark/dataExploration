The data used for the project is imprese-fvg, a dataset curated by Area Science Park as a part of innovation intelligence project, which aggregates information on companies in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region from different sources (sectors of activity, age, balance sheet data, financial ratings, participation in European projects, patents, certifications ) The project has been written using R-Studio and rendered with boowdown package. The project is divided in 4 sections: introduction: working on a toy dataset, where each company is represented by 5 features, to learn basic data structures and computation imprese-fvg: loading the data from excel and csv files to a data.frame, subsetting financial-indicators managing dates: calculating the age of companies based on several dates handling non metric features: defining a custimized similarity function to identify similar companies and estimate distances in a multi dimensional space.
