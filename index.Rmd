# Scope and objectives  

This notebook explores the datasets that will presumably underpin future research work for the PhD in Applied Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

## Background information: 
Area Science Park is a national research body that manages a science and technology park in Trieste (Italy), hosting 60 companies (tenants) engaged in research activities in the fields of ICT, lifesceinces and materials.
Area is interested in measuring the effectiveness and efficiency of its activities, focusing in particular on monitoring the economic performance of tenans and comparing them with "similar" companies (mainly at a regional or national scale, but also with respect to the science and technology parks in Austria and Slovenia).

Area Science Park can provide some relevant datasets as a part of the project [*innovation intelligence*](https://www.innovationintelligence.it/) that aims to analyze information on companies in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region. Main sources include the chamber of commerce, the Regional Labor Market Observatory, a rating agency, as well as surveys on samples of companies. 

## About this notebook 
The notebook is divided in 6 sections: an introduction, a section for each dataset and a final section on potential future development.

1. Imprese_FVG
2. Bilanci_FVG
3. Rating_FVG 
4. CO_FVG
5. Features: A basic example of sample feature selection, on a small subset, where each company is represented by 5 features 
6. Further development: calculating the age of companies based on several dates, handling non metric features: defining a custimized similarity function to identify *similar* companies and estimate distances in a multi-dimensional space.


The notebook has been  written using **R-Studio** and rendered with [**boowdown**](https://bookdown.org/) package.
